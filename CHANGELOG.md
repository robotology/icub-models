# [2.2.2] - 2023-07-10

### Fixed

* Fix version number in CMake and package.xml files.

# [2.2.1] - 2023-07-10

### Fixed

* Fix Gazebo Classic simulation of iCub 2.* and 3 models, that stopped working since the 2.1.0 release (https://github.com/robotology/icub-models-generator/pull/240). Note that this fix highlighted a bug in icub-models that was introduced in 1.26.0, namely that the names of the FT sensors in the iCub models is not consistent with the real robot. This issue will be fixed in a future release, see https://github.com/robotology/icub-models-generator/issues/242 for more details.

### Changed

* Tune position PID gains for torso for iCub 2.* (https://github.com/robotology/icub-models-generator/pull/241).

# [2.2.0] - 2023-06-27

**Due to an error, this release did not contained improvements.**

# [2.1.0] - 2023-06-05

### Changed

* For consistency with the robot, now iCub simulated models publish their Force-Torque Sensors measurements via the [`multipleanalogsensorsserver`](https://www.yarp.it/latest//classMultipleAnalogSensorsServer.html) YARP device (https://github.com/robotology/icub-models/issues/198, https://github.com/robotology/icub-models-generator/pull/239, https://github.com/robotology/robots-configuration/pull/517).  The `name`  parameter passed to this device is: `/<robotPortPrefix>/<partName>/FT`.  This means that for each part there will be a `multipleanalogsensorsserver` device that will open the following YARP ports (these YARP ports are not meant to be accessed directly, but should be accessed instead via the [`multipleanalogsensorsclient`](https://www.yarp.it/git-master/classMultipleAnalogSensorsClient.html) device):
  * `/<robotPortPrefix>/<partName>/FT/measures:o` : that publishes sensors information for the part, using the structure defined in https://github.com/robotology/yarp/blob/master/src/devices/multipleAnalogSensorsMsgs/multipleAnalogSensorsSerializations.thrift
  * `/<robotPortPrefix>/<partName>/FT/rpc:o` : that expose several information related to the part via a YARP RPC port

## [1.21.0] - 2021-08-27

### Added
* The `hand_mk3` and `wrist_mk2` containing the new version of iCub's hand and wrist, codenamed iCub hand Mk3 and iCub wrist Mk2, have been added to the repo. As this models are still in development, they could change in the future (https://github.com/robotology/icub-models-generator/pull/203, https://github.com/robotology/icub-models/pull/95).

### Changed
* The iCub3 models (`iCubGenova09` and `iCubGazeboV3`) have been updated with the new arm covers (https://github.com/robotology/icub-models-generator/pull/202).

### Fixed 
* The masses of iCub3 models (`iCubGenova09` and `iCubGazeboV3`) have been fixed to be more similar to the one of the real robot (https://github.com/robotology/icub-models-generator/pull/207).


## [1.20.0] - 2021-05-30

### Changed
* The gains and damping parameters of `iCubGazeboV3` have been changed (https://github.com/robotology/icub-models-generator/pull/199).

## [1.19.0] - 2021-02-24

### Added 
- Added documentation to use the models in ROS2 (https://github.com/robotology/icub-models/pull/82).
- Added model for the iCubErzelli02 robot (https://github.com/robotology/icub-models-generator/pull/195).

### Fixed 
- Fixed the license tag in the package.xml for use the models in ROS/ROS2 (https://github.com/robotology/icub-models/pull/78).
- Fixed several issues and problems with the iCubGenova09/iCubGazeboV3 model (https://github.com/robotology/icub-models-generator/pull/194, https://github.com/robotology/icub-models-generator/pull/193, https://github.com/robotology/icub-models-generator/pull/189, https://github.com/robotology/icub-models-generator/pull/187). 

## [1.18.1] - 2020-11-30

### Fixed 
- Fix the direction of some axis for the iCub3 models (https://github.com/robotology/icub-models-generator/pull/184). 

## [1.18.0] - 2020-11-30

### Added
- Added first URDF model for the iCub3, namely the `iCubGazeboV3`  with inertia modified to run in Gazebo Classic, and iCubGenova09 for control of the real robot. 
  As the development of this model is an ongoing activity, interested users are suggested to keep in sync with the updates that will happen in the `devel` branch. 

### Changed
- The `base_link` massless link is now a child of the `root_link` link instead of being a parent. This has the effect that now when the URDF model of iCub is imported
  in Gazebo, after fixed joint lumping the link corresponding to the robot waist will be `root_link`, instead of `base_link`. This means that when the iCub model is included 
  in a nested model, the joint to connect it to the rest of the model should refer to `iCub::root_link` instead of `iCub::base_link`
  (https://github.com/robotology/icub-models-generator/pull/142, https://github.com/robotology/icub-models-generator/issues/140#issuecomment-700653608).
